 # Real-Time Disaster Detection Using Machine Learning 🌍🔥

Hi! I'm a engineering student currently diving deep into the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. This is one of my first real projects where I try to apply what I'm learning to something that could actually make a difference.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This is a beginner-friendly (but growing) system that uses AI and machine learning models to detect and predict natural disasters like forest fires, floods, etc. based on data. I'm experimenting with real-time data (APIs/sensors), classification models, and alert systems.

## 📌 Main Goals

- Understand how AI and machine learning can help prevent disasters
- Build something real that might help in the future
- Learn the tools professionals use (like Python, Pandas, etc.)
- Eventually make it smart enough for real-world deployment

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Streamlit (UI)

## 🤔 Why I'm Building This

I'm just starting my journey in Data Science, but I'm passionate about solving real-world problems — especially those related to the environment and safety. If you're someone who works in AI, feel free to drop me feedback or ideas!

## 🧩 Future Plans

- Connect with live data APIs (weather/satellite)
- Use Deep Learning models (CNNs or LSTMs maybe?)
- Collaborate with people working on similar ideas
- Learn more about how big tech (like Google AI or DeepMind) tackles problems like this

## 📬 Let’s Connect

If you're a fellow student, researcher, or just someone who thinks AI can help the world — I’d love to connect and learn together.
